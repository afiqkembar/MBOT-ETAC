        <p>The Registration of Engineers Act 1967 and the Registration of Engineers Regulations 1990 have been amended in 2015 with date of operation on 31st July 2015.

        <p>These latest amendments are a direct result of Government policies on trade for services. As Malaysia developed towards a service industry the issue of “liberalisation” of the services came to the forefront in the Free Trade Agreements (FTA) which the country signed. These latest amendments directly address liberalisation issues in order for the country to meet its international obligations.</p>

        <p>The need to regulate the Engineering Team; Engineers, Engineering Technologists and Engineering Technicians has also led the BEM to amend the REA to incorporate two new categories: Engineering Technologists and Inspector of Works (also known as Engineering Technicians).</p>
